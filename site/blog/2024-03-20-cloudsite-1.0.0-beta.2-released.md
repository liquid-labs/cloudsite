We've updated Cloudsite beta ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudsite), [GitHub](https://github.com/liquid-labs/cloudsite)) with support for Cost Allocation tags! You can now easily track and set budgets for your site. Additional new features allow you to cleanly destroy sites and import site data from running sites and (re)build the local database. There have also been numerous bug fixes and other minor improvements. You can [read the changelog here](https://github.com/liquid-labs/cloudsite/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.2).
