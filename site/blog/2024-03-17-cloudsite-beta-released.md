Cloudsite works seamlessly with Docusaurus, which enables blogs, wikis, and simple React integration. Because Docusaurus is built with Markdown support, users can build rich sites without knowing any HTML. Of course, Cloudsite also works with any static website (which can still support dynamic content). With built in support for contact form processing, capture, and notification, Cloudsite is the perfect solution for professional, commercial, and personal websites.
