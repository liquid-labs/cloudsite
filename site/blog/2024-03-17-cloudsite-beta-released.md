The Cloudsite ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudsite), [GitHub](https://github.com/liquid-labs/cloudsite)) beta is now available for download and general use. Cloudsite is a low cost, high performance cloud based website hosting solution featuring CDN integration, DoS protection, free SSL certificates, and contact forms. In addition, since Cloudsite use "pay as you go" cloud infrastructure, hosting costs are generally well below typical market rates.

Cloudsite works seamlessly with Docusaurus, which enables blogs, wikis, and simple React integration. Because Docusaurus is built with Markdown support, users can build rich sites without knowing any HTML. Of course, Cloudsite also works with any static website (which can still support dynamic content). With built in support for contact form processing, capture, and notification, Cloudsite is the perfect solution for professional, commercial, and personal websites.

Usage instructions and more information are available on the [CloudSite homepage](https://github.com/liquid-labs/cloudsite). As always, support is available via [our discord channel](https://discord.gg/QWAav6fZ5C).
