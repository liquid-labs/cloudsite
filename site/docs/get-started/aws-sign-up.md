# AWS Sign Up

Since Cloudsite builds your site on AWS infrastructure, you'll need an AWS account to use Cloudsite.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a multi-user environment, so when you sign up you're creating the "root" account. If you ever need to, you could add additional users, each with different permissions and roles.

### Create a dedicated email address (optional)

If you are using Cloudsite for your own websites, it's fine to use your personal email address for the root account. If you're setting things up for a company, you'll want to create an email alias or that can be assigned (and potentially re-assigned later) to the root account manager. E.g.: 'awsroot@your-domain.com'.
