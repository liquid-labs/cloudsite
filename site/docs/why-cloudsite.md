Otherwise, refer to the [register/configure a domain flow chart](/docs/get-started/register-configure-a-domain) for guidance on the specific steps to take.
- <span class="callout">Built in support for contact forms.</span> Form submissions are saved in a database you get optional email alerts every time someone fills out your contact form.
