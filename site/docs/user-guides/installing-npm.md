# Installing NPM

NPM is a package manager installed with Node; hence 'Node Package Manager' or 'NPM'. It can be used to install user tools as well as libraries used in developing software for Node. Cloudsite is distributed as an NPM package and runs on Node.

There are many different ways to install Node/NPM and advanced users who might want to develop with node should refer to the [Node download and install page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager). For users who just want to install cloudsite and perhaps other end-user tools, we recommend what we believe to be the simplest methods below:

## Installing for the Mac

__Option 1__: Homebrew

If you have Homebrew installed, that's probably the easiest way to install and keep node up to date. Open a terminal (Applications => Utilities => Terminal) and type the following:
```bash
brew install node@latest
```

__Option 2__: PKG installer

If you don't have or don't know what Homebrew is, don't worry. Just use the pre-built PKG installer. Goto the [Node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and it should detect your platform type. Double check the OS and architecture are correct (if you know them) and simply download and install the Node package.

## Installing for Windows

Goto the [Node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and it should detect your platform type. Double check Windows is selected and download and install the Node package.

## Linux

__Option 1__: Install using the system package manager

If you're using Linux and you know what a package manager is, Node is almost certainly offered.

__Option 2__: Install using NVM

NVM or the 'Node version manager' is like a mini-package manager specifically to allow you to install, manage, and select different versions of Node. To install using the latest NVM, refer to the [Node package manager installation page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and select 'Linux' as the OS and 'NVM' as the package manager.
