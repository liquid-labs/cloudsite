# Build Semi-Manually

Building a website manually means creating the HTML+CSS+Javascript files that make up the site yourself, or having a web designer do it for you. Describing exactly how HTML+CSS+Javascript works is a big task and well beyond the scope of this document. Instead, we will here describe some basic approaches suitable for a layman.

## Use a template

Many professional sites are simple one (or few) page sites that can be built using templates. There are numerous templates available so you don't have to start from scratch; you can download the template and then edit to add your colors and content. Here are some resources for HTML templates:

- [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/)
- [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/templates/free-templates)
- [Free CSS](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates)
- [W3Schools templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp)
- [nicepage](https://nicepage.com/html-templates)
- [templatemo](https://templatemo.com/#google_vignette)

You can google 'html templates' or 'html templates free' for additional resources.

## Hire a web designer

There are numerous web designers out there. You can search for design professionals/companies through google, or go through a gig site, which generally provide reviews, ratings, and a portfolio for you to consider. Here are some gig work sites to help you get started:

- [99Designs](99designs.com): An Australian site specializing in design services.
- [Fiverr](https://fiverr.com): One of the most popular gig work sites.
- [Upwork](https://upwork.com): Another very popular gig work site.
- [Guru.com](https://guru.com)
- [Truelancer.com](https://trulancer.com)

You can also google 'web design services', 'web design gig', or similar.

## Learn HTML+CSS

This option isn't exclusive of the others and while becoming adept at HTML and CSS in general is a tall order, learning some basics that will allow you to edit content and make simple design changes isn't all that hard. There are plenty of courses out there, such as those offered by [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), and [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/html), all of which offer free courses. You can of course google 'learn HTML and CSS' to find many more options. We're also ready to help you and answer any questions you may have along the way with our affordable [website support](/support#website-support) option.
