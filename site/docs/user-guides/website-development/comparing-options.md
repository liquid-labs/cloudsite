## Overview

### Docusaurus

Docusaurus is relatively simple to get started with and great for creating blogs, wikis, and knowledge-bases. The interface is essentially file based; you add content by writing Markdown files. The Markdown syntax itself is simple and easy to learn.

Docusaurus look and feel is highly customizable, but it's best if one has some knowledge of HTML+CSS. While it has support for 'themes' these more like plugins rather than "look and feel" themes and styling Docusaurus is similar to styling a manually built site except that you're starting out with a well thought out and relatively adaptable styling framework.

It's built to support and plugins, but [resources are very limited](https://github.com/webbertakken/awesome-docusaurus).

### WordPress

WordPress can be a pain to set up, but if you want or need a graphical interface that's [supported by cloudsite](/support), then this is the solution for you. WordPress has a wealth of look and feel themes and feature plugins and can be customized with no HTML+CSS knowledge.

WordPress is by far the easiest to theme for look and feel. At the same time, customizing the look and feel (i.e., modifying or creating a theme) is quite involved and requires knowledge of not only HTML+CSS, but also deep knowledge of the inner-workings of WP itself. You can find a theme you like, but then you're more or less stuck with that theme.

WP also has a wealth of feature plugins. One has to think about what will work with Cloudsite a bit (or as [support](/support) for input). Plugins are also of wildly varying quality, so finding what you want and configuring it for your site can sometimes be harder than one would hope. But that doesn't change the fact that the WP ecosystem is by far the richest.

### Other CMSs

Like WordPress, other CMSs such as [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), and [Textpattern](https://textpattern.com/) provide static site generator plugins or methods. All such options provide a graphical interface and generally have a rich theme and plugin ecosystems. They will vary in complexity and features to some extent, but most any could be used with cloudsite.

### Manual creation

Finally, there's the option to just create HTML+CSS files more or less by hand. While there are many style frameworks and feature libraries that one can use in the construction of such a site, some knowledge of HTML+CSS and probably Javascript as well will be essential.

There are many HTML+CSS style frameworks available and some themes, but usually one would go this route (in part) to maximize customization. I.e., you can get exactly what you want. There are a large number of web designers that can create the basic site, allowing the owner to copy-paste templates to create new content.

## By task/feature

### General website

It all comes down to what you know. Docusaurus is easy to set up and get going and you create content via text files. WordPress takes some setting up, but provides a graphical interface.

### Blogging

Any of the non-manual options are good choices for a blogging platform. Docusaurus is probably the easiest to set up and use if you're comfortable working with text files. If a graphical interface is important to you, then WordPress or another CMS is the way to go.

### Knowledgebase

This is where Docusaurus really shines. Though, again, if you want/need a graphical interface then WordPress or another (perhaps purpose built) CMS will be the way to go.

### Wiki

Docusaurus has built in support for wikis, but it's not focused on that feature set and it takes a little fiddling. WordPress does have a number of wiki plugins available as well.

There are a number of special purpose wiki CMSs. [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) (which powers [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) is the granddaddy of them all and could be combined with static site generation to be compatible with cloudsite. Some, simpler options such as [DocuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) (which doesn't require a database) might relatively easily setup and converted to a static site.
