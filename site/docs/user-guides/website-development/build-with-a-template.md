# Build with a Template

With the availability of templates and tomes of reference material, building a custom or semi-custom website is actually within reach and may be the best option for putting together a small marketing or other simple website. In this article, we'll go over some methods you can use to get exactly what you want without too much cost or effort.

## Why build a custom site?

Some good use cases for building a custom site:
- You want a site that looks "just so".
- You need a small marketing website and you want to represent your brand.
- You want to put up a personal resume site.
- You only need a one-pager or a handful of pages.

## Start with a template

Websites are jut text files and while HTML+CSS can be complex, it's easy enough to take an existing template and insert your own content or even make small changes (like brand colors). There are literally thousands of free templates available on the Internet so there's a good chance you'll be able to find one that really works for you.

Here are some resources for HTML templates:
<div class="flow-list">
- [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/templates/free-templates): perfect for one page sites, offers 100+ high quality templates.
- [nicepage](https://nicepage.com/html-templates): with 15,000+ templates, this is thankfully one of the more navigable sites offering search by target industry and key words.
- [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/): offers a substantial, but limited set of highly curated and various templates.
- [templatemo](https://templatemo.com/#google_vignette): almost 600 templates organized by target industry and features; includes one-page templates.
- [Free CSS](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates): 3,500+ templates can be a bit overwhelming, but there's plenty to choose from.
- [W3Schools templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp): offers a number of high quality purpose specific templates (resume, image portfolio, apartment rental, etc.).
</div>

Because of the large number of (sometimes unorganized) templates, you might also try googling for your specific needs. E.g., "one-page tech startup html template" will turn up a number of resources providing just that.

## Learn a little HTML+CSS

While becoming adept at HTML and CSS in general is a tall order, learning some basics that will allow you to edit content and make simple design changes. There are plenty of courses out there, such as those offered by [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), and [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/html), all of which offer free courses.

## Hire a web designer

If you're not married to the idea of a "website for free", for a minimum of $200-$500 you could hire someone to produce a site design for you. You can search for design professionals/companies through google, or go through a gig site, which generally provide reviews, ratings, and a portfolio for you to consider. Here are some gig work sites to help you get started:
<div class="flow-list">
- [99Designs](https://99designs.com): An Australian site specializing in design services.
- [Guru.com](https://guru.com): A very user friendly site with tons of information available on any prospective freelancer/agency.
- [Fiverr](https://fiverr.com): One of the most popular gig work sites, this may be the "value" option.
- [Upwork](https://upwork.com): Another popular gig work site, Upwork lets you search job packages or post your own job and solicit bids.
</div>

Fiverr and Upwork seem to offer the most discounted rates. You may be able to spec your own job and save some money by posting a request for bids on Upwork.
