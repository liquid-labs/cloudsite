# Domain Name Selection

Your website needs someplace to _be_, and that's where domain names come in. A domain name is a (hopefully) user friendly name that acts as the address for your website. In this document, we will go over how to select and register a good domain name.

A good domain name should match your brand, be memorable, and easy to spell. This can be challenging because the most obvious names are already taken. But, with a little creativity, there are still plenty of good domain names to be had. In this article, will go through a step by step process to select a good domain name.

## Terminology

- _Domain hacking_ is where you use the domain name to spell or suggest a brand name, word, or phrase. E.g., 'bit.ly', 'simpli.city', 'ac.es', 'main.st', etc.
- _Domain name_ generally refers to the bit before the last dot + the TLD. E.g., 'google.com', 'amazon.com', 'liquid-labs.com', etc. This is also known as the 'apex domain'.
- _Domain name system_ or _DNS_ translates domain names into the IP addresses that browsers actually use to retrieve content.
- _Registrar_ refers to a company where you can register a domain name.
- _Resale market_ refers to domain names which are bought to be resold rather than used.
- _Top level domain_ or _TLD_ is the last bit in a domain name. E.g., '.com', '.org', '.us', etc.

## Select a domain name

### Checking a domain name's status

To start with, you'll need to be able to tell whether a domain name is already taken. We recommend [NameCheap.com](https://namecheap.com) for searching. You can use other registrars and tools, but NameCheap.com does one of the better jobs of showing you names available through the resale market and they offer a wide range of TLD options.

### Selection process

1. Brainstorm base names.
2. Determine applicable TLDs. Can the you use domain hacking?
3. Try suffix and prefix variations.
4. Brainstorm again and repeat.
5. As a last resort, _maybe_ try hyphens or clever spellings.

### Brainstorming base names

The process starts with brainstorming base names. If you already have a brand name that you want or must use, then you've got a clear starting point. Domain names are, however, so central to a business that domain names and brand names are generally co-determined at the same time.

You'll probably start with a few names in mind. These are themselves almost certainly taken, but that's just the way it is. Some good ways to generate possible names are:
- Asking other people for ideas.
- Using a thesaurus to generate alternate names.
- Describe your product/service/site to ChatGPT and ask it to generate a dozen or so possible domain names. Do this a few times (since it will come up with different answers each time) and pick out the ones you like.
- Search for "domain name generators" and you'll find numerous sites that will generate domain names (and often show you availability) based on keywords or a short description.

Regarding the last option, just be aware that some of these tools are fronts for domain name resellers and they may push you towards names they already own. In the worst case scenario, a name might be free when you search it, but the reseller buys it when you indicate interest and tries to resell it back to you.

### Determine applicable TLDs

Generally, a .com domain (or .org for a non-profit) is considered "the best" if you can get it, but a better name with another TLD is usually better than a poor .com (or .org) name. The three next most popular general purpose TLDs are .net,[^1] .co, and .io.

[^1]: .net domains used to have a more specific implication, but now-a-days are pretty much general purpose.

Check if any of your possible base names can be used in domain hacking. Recall, this is where the domain itself spells out our suggests a word or phrase. Refer to the list of TLDs and check see if any TLDs match the last two to four letters of your possible domain names.

Also, there are many business type, profession, and theme specific domain TLDs such as .ai, .law, .doctors, .dog, .wedding, etc. Search or read through the list of TLDs to find ones that might work and try them out in combination with possible names.

### Try variations

Try adding suffixes and/or prefixes to your base names to generate even more possibilities. For instance, some generic options are:
- \_lab, \_labs
- \_central
- \_town, \_city, \_world, \_nation
- \_source
- \_solutions
- \_club
- the\_
- get\_, use\_
- my\_, our\_
- pro\_, elite\_, champion\_, ace\_, legendary\_, top\_, first\_, \_alpha\_, \_best\_
- \_craft
- cyber\_
- meta\_
- smart\_
- \_classic\_
- \_quantum\_

Some more product and service specific options include:
- \_media
- \_interactive\_
- \_digital\_, \_tech\_
- \_retail\_, \_shop\_
- \_wealth\_, \_capital\_
- \_med\_, \_gene\_

[This article](https://dailyblogtips.com/200-prefixes-and-suffixes-for-domain-names/) provides a decent list of additional possibilities.

Also, when searching for domain names, NameCheap (and most other registrars) will suggest alternates as you search. Scan the list of alternates to see if any of them work for you.

### Rinse and repeat

You may have to repeat this process a few times before you find something you like and is free. Each time through should generate new variations and ideas. Since it's relatively cheap to purchase a domain name, a lot of names are taken up by domain resellers which, if you have the money, may be an option. But if you're trying to find something more affordable, don't despair. You may end up with something even better than you started with. (Though the prevalence of squatters certainly sucks.)

### Hyphens, clever spellings, and numbers

Hyphens and especially misspellings should be avoided where possible. This is because no one will know there's a hyphen or exactly how you're misspelling the domain if you just say the name, so you always have to spell it out, which can be clunky and may not be remembered anyway.

This isn't a hard "never", though, since most of the times people click on links rather than type in names. My own domain name, 'liquid-labs.com' is hyphenated. In retrospect, I wish I'd spent more time and found an un-hyphenated alternative, and also, it's been OK.

Personally, I would avoid misspellings or "clever" spellings more than hyphens. IMO, a clever spelling has a higher chance for confusion and is easier to misread or just forget. And while the position of a hyphen is clear, there are numerous ways as to how exactly you might misspell a domain.

Numbers, like clever spellings, can be confusing. If you end up using numbers, you'll have to be explicit whether it's "spelled out" or "the digits".

But, if you have just the perfect name and it's available with a hyphen-or even a clever enough spelling to be memorable spelling-I wouldn't say never. If you love it, and you have the perfect branding idea, then that counts for a lot. 

## Registering your domain name

The registration process itself is rather straightforward. You just go to your registrar of choice, tell them the name you want, select a term, and then pay some money. We offer just a few notes.

First, in selecting a registrar remember it can be different than the registrar where you did your searching. If you're here specifically for the 'Host Your Own Website Free and Easy' series, then we recommend you register with [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). Otherwise, [Namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) is a good option, or you can just google 'registrar' and find one you like. Personally, I recommend staying away from GoDaddy.

Second, you should sign up for "privacy protection" or "domain privacy". When you register a domain name, you have to provide contact information to establish ownership. By default, this information is publicly available unless you add a privacy protection service. Some registrars (like AWS Route 53) offer this for free, while others may charge a small fee.

Finally, just know that you'll see some difference in pricing for domains from different registrars. Any big difference (like 50% off) is always going to be an initial price only. The prices for domains are more or less set and should pretty much cost the same (in the long run) everywhere. You can save a little by using a registrar that offer privacy protection for free.

## In closing

- A domain name that works with your branding is probably the most important things
- A domain name should be memorable and ideally, easy to spell.
- Generally avoid hyphens, clever spellings, and numbers.

Once you have a domain name and you've [built your site](/docs/category/website-development), you're ready to [deploy your first website](/docs/get-started/your-first-site).
